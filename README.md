# Description

Welcome to GSale, a full-stack garage sale event organizer application that allows users to search for the hottest local deals in their area or host their own sale.

This platform aims to be a fun and unique way for users to filter through available sales by date, location, and item category based on their needs. Additionally, users will be able to create their own sale event listing.

Our goal is to help users explore their creative side by offering a balance between simplicity and robust functionality all within one easy-to-use application.

Check out our deployed project [here](https://gsalefrontend.herokuapp.com/)!
